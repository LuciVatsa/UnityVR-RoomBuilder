Virtual Reality Enhanced Hospital Room Design for Fall Risk Reduction
Project Description

This pioneering project focuses on the design and creation of virtual reality (VR) hospital rooms, aimed at enhancing patient safety and reducing fall risks. By employing advanced technological solutions, the project offers a novel approach to hospital room design, prioritizing both functionality and patient safety.
Key Features

    Immersive VR Hospital Rooms: The project involves the creation of highly realistic VR hospital rooms. These environments are not only visually immersive but also interactive, providing a realistic simulation of hospital settings with added props for enhanced realism.

    Data Collection with Unity DOTS and ECS: Utilizing Unity's Data-Oriented Technology Stack (DOTS) and Entity Component System (ECS), the project efficiently gathers position and orientation data on subjects. This data is crucial in calculating metrics like step length, height, and turning angles, which are key indicators of fall risk.

    Fall Risk Evaluation Algorithms: The system evaluates fall risks by analyzing the collected data. This includes assessing step length, height differences, and turning angles, all of which are critical factors in determining the likelihood of falls in hospital settings.

    Collision and Proximity Detection for Patient Safety: Advanced collision and proximity detection algorithms have been developed and integrated into the VR rooms. These algorithms play a vital role in ensuring patient safety by preventing potential collisions and identifying risky proximities within the room layout.

    Procedural Room Generator: A standout feature of the project is the procedural room generator. This innovative tool uses the metrics collected to design potential room layouts. Optimizing around factors such as fall risk, step length, and the number of turns a patient makes, helps in creating safer and more efficient hospital room designs.

Value in Healthcare

    Innovative Approach to Room Design: The project introduces a new paradigm in hospital room design, where safety and efficiency are enhanced through VR simulations and data-driven insights.
    Reduction in Fall Risks: By focusing on key metrics associated with falls, the project contributes significantly to reducing fall risks in hospital settings, enhancing patient safety.
    Enhanced Patient Experience: The immersive VR environment not only aids in room design but can also be used for patient education and acclimatization, thereby improving the overall patient experience in hospitals.
    Cost-Effective and Scalable Solutions: Virtual simulations allow for multiple iterations and testing of room designs without the need for physical restructuring, making it a cost-effective solution for hospitals.
