# UnityVR-RoomBuilder
VR Hospital Rooms with Enhanced Immersion, Fall Risk Evaluation, and Procedural Room Generation
Overview:

This GitHub project introduces Virtual Reality (VR) hospital rooms designed for enhanced immersion, safety assessment, and procedural room generation. Leveraging Unity, Data-Oriented Technology Stack (DOTS), and Entity Component System (ECS), the system collects position and orientation data to calculate metrics such as step length, height, turning angles, etc. These metrics are utilized for fall risk evaluation. Additionally, the project features a procedural room generator that optimizes room designs around fall risk, step length, and the number of turns made by a patient.
Key Features:

    Immersive VR Hospital Rooms:
        Creation of virtual hospital rooms with enhanced immersion, featuring an innovative system design to add props and elements for a realistic healthcare VR experience.

    Unity DOTS and ECS Integration:
        Utilization of Unity DOTS and ECS for efficient data collection and management of position and orientation information.
        Calculation of metrics like step length, height, and turning angles using DOTS to evaluate fall risk.

    Fall Risk Evaluation:
        Implementation of algorithms to evaluate fall risk based on collected metrics in real-time.
        Insights into user movements within VR hospital rooms to identify and prevent potential fall risks.

    Collision and Proximity Detection:
        Design and implementation of collision detection algorithms to ensure patient safety within the virtual environment.
        Proximity detection features to prevent collisions with virtual objects and surroundings.

    Procedural Room Generator:
        Development of a procedural room generator that utilizes fall risk, step length, and turn metrics to create potential room designs.
        Optimization of room layouts to improve fall risk, taking into account patient movement patterns and safety considerations.
