This was only partly made by me so I am a little lost on how the initial developer was trying to structure things.

The CSV export pre-fab should now hold all of the recording things but I have not filled out any of the text fields or format anything for you so you will need to work on that

It should be as simple as changing the track game objects list length and add whatever you want in there. This will act a lot more like a mocap system giving you data 90 times a second for every item in that list
This can be useful but some times is more data than you would ever need and the google drive solution can be used for simplicity.
