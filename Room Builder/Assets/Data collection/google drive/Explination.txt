Go into google forms (forms.google.com) and create a form that has a field for each event you wan to collect

Click on the view form icon in the top right and then copy the URL and paste it into the googledrive script under base URL, but you must remove the "/viewform" part at the end of the url

Then you can get the name tag for each field you want to populate and put those in for the form ID's under the corisponding event in the script.

Then assign the grab and release events to trigger the grab and submit functions in the googleDrive script
